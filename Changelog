libaosc-1.0.2:
    - Added a manpage outlining the use of libaosc.
    - x86-64 support for ASCII-only encoding has been provided, and the
      i386_ascii module was renamed to x86_ascii.
    - x86_ascii now has a consistent interface (a lot of refactoring).
    - x86_ascii should now be (more) endian safe, so this library can
      be used in remote exploits launched from big endian machines.
    - A bug in __aosc_split_and_8() caused 0x20 values to be returned,
      this issue has been addressed.
